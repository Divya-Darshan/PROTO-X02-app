## Overview

**Proto-x02** is a Blender add-on designed to streamline video-based photogrammetry workflows. It automates repetitive tasks like project setup, folder organization, file placeholders, template copying, tracking, and rendering. Additionally, it allows packaging the project into a zip file using a custom bot command (`I`) with 7-Zip.

The add-on integrates directly into the **Video Sequencer** interface (`Sidebar ‚Üí N`) and provides intuitive operators for a smooth workflow.

This project was inspired by the **Poly Ford YouTube channel**, which showcases advanced video-to-3D pipelines and photogrammetry techniques. This add-on aims to automate many steps shown in those videos.

## Features

### 1. Video Import
- Supports `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mkv` formats.
- Copies selected video into the `02 VIDEOS` folder.
- Automatically adds the video to the **Sequencer** for tracking and editing.
- Stores the last imported video path to manage cleanup and workflow continuity.

### 2. Project Folder Automation
- Automatically creates the following folder structure:
01 GLOMAP
02 VIDEOS
03 FFMPEG
04 SCENES
05 SCRIPT

- Generates **placeholder files** for common extensions like `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.dll`, `.exe`, `.zip`, etc., preventing empty folder errors.
- Copies **template files** (like example `.glomap` files, `track.bat`, `ffmpeg.exe`) into their respective folders.
- Recursively copies **dependencies** including DLLs, plugins, and executables, while ensuring only `track.bat` is added in `05 SCRIPT`.

### 3. Auto-Tracking & Rendering
- Runs the `track.bat` script from `05 SCRIPT` in a **visible terminal window** on Windows.
- Automatically outputs results to `04 SCENES`.
- Provides UI buttons to **start** and **cancel** tracking.
- Uses Blender properties to prevent multiple tracker instances and provides real-time feedback.
- Avoids opening Blender console or confusing terminal windows for the user.

### 4. Cleanup
- Deletes the last imported video if the corresponding Sequencer strip is removed.
- Ensures your project folder remains organized without leftover files.

### 5. Custom Bot Command (`I`)
- Pressing the `I` key triggers a zip archive of the project using **7-Zip**.
- Deletes any existing zip to avoid conflicts.
- Creates a zip in the **same project directory**, ready for sharing or backup.

## How It Works (Functionality Explained)

1. **Open Video**  
 - The user selects a video file via the "Open Video" button.
 - The add-on creates necessary folders, placeholder files, and copies template and dependency files automatically.
 - The video is copied into `02 VIDEOS` and added to the Blender Sequencer.

2. **Run Tracker**  
 - Pressing "Track & Render" executes the `track.bat` file inside a terminal.
 - `track.bat` handles GloMAP/FFMPEG processing, generating scene outputs in `04 SCENES`.
 - Blender UI indicates that tracking is in progress.
 - Tracking can be **cancelled** safely via the "Cancel Tracking" button.

3. **Automated Folder & File Management**  
 - Ensures the project is self-contained.
 - Handles placeholder files and dependencies to reduce errors during tracking and rendering.

4. **Project Packaging**  
 - The custom `I` command packages the project into a zip archive using 7-Zip.
 - Ideal for sharing the project, archiving, or submission purposes.

## Usage

1. Install the add-on in Blender (`Edit ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Install`).
2. Open the **Video Sequencer**.
3. Use the **Sidebar (N)** panel labeled "Photogrammetry" to:
 - Open a video
 - Run tracking
 - Cancel tracking if needed
4. Press **I** to generate a zip archive of your project.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by **Poly Ford YouTube channel** for photogrammetry workflow ideas.
- Blender Python API for seamless add-on integration.
- 7-Zip for project packaging.

---

## Notes

- Tested on **Windows** only (uses `cmd /K` to show terminal).
- Blender must have a saved `.blend` file for the project root to be detected.
- Ensure **7-Zip** is installed and accessible via the system PATH for the `I` command to work.
